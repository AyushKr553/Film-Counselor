# Movie Recommender System

*Film Counselor* is film recommending web application. By entering or searching for the name of the film by the user in the search bar, it analyzes the input and suggests similar films using a recommendation algorithm. The project showcases skills in web development, data handling, and recommendation systems. 
Our NLP-powered Web App delivers tailored suggestions based on cast and genres of the searched film.

Find and Watch, from the ocean of great films!

## Concept used: *Cosine Similarity*
(1)Cosine Similarity is a metric used to measure the similarity between documents.

(2)To demonstrate the cosine similarity function, we need vectors, which are represented as NumPy arrays.

(3)Once we have the vectors, we can compute the cosine similarity by passing them to the cosine_similarity() function. This function calculates the similarity between the two vectors.

(4)The result will be a value between 0 and 1. A score of 0 indicates that the vectors are completely different, while a score of 1 means they are identical.
